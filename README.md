📊 Project Title: Customer Churn Prediction Analysis
An analysis of customer data to predict churn and identify key factors driving customer attrition. This project explores, visualizes, and models the dataset to provide actionable insights.

Project Overview
1. Business Problem
A telecommunications company is experiencing high customer churn rates. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict which customers are most likely to churn, allowing the company to proactively offer them incentives.

2. Data Source
The dataset used for this project is the "Telco Customer Churn" dataset, originally from Kaggle. It contains information about customer demographics, account details, and services they've signed up for.

3. Methodology
The project follows these steps:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data to uncover trends and correlations.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features to improve model performance.

Model Building: Training and evaluating several classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).

Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

Conclusion: Summarizing findings and providing business recommendations.

📈 Results & Key Findings
The final XGBoost model achieved an accuracy of 82% on the test set.

Key predictors of churn include: contract type (month-to-month is high risk), tenure (newer customers churn more), and subscribing to fiber optic internet service.

Insight: Customers on short-term contracts with premium services are the most volatile segment.
